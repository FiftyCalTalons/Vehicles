Install .meta and .dat files to the same folder that your stream folder sits. For example mine looks like this:

GTA SERVER > resources > vehicles(inside of this one) > stream > (vehicle folders) > .ytds|yfts

Drag and drop ambulance, firetruk, and police folders inside of the stream folder and overwright.

If you have any questions let me know.
